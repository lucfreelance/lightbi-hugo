Description: "The narrative often paints humanity as a destructive force, an enemy of the environment. However, a more nuanced perspective reveals that humans possess incredible potential to be stewards of the planet. By harnessing our creativity, innovation, and compassion, we have the capacity to mend the wounds inflicted on nature and forge a path towards coexistence and healing."

Hugo ships with several [Built-in Shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#use-hugos-built-in-shortcodes) for rich content, along with a Privacy Config and a set of Simple Shortcodes that enable static and no-JS versions of various social media embeds.

## YouTube Privacy Enhanced Shortcode

The youtube shortcode embeds a responsive video player for YouTube videos. Only the ID of the video is required, e.g.:

{{< youtube zYXudK0jyfI >}}
