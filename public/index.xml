With the proliferation of digital devices and entertainment options, many young minds are captivated by virtual realities, often disconnected from the tangible beauty of the Earth.
This disconnection from nature not only robs children of the intrinsic joy of exploring the outdoors but also hampers their ability to comprehend the delicate balance that sustains life on our planet.</description>
