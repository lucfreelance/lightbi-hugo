Learn In Public  If there’s a golden rule, it’s this one, so I put it first. All the other rules are more or less elaborations of this rule #1.
A habit of creating learning exhaust:
 Write blogs and tutorials and cheatsheets. Speak at meetups and conferences. Ask and answer things on Stackoverflow or Reddit. Avoid the walled gardens like Slack and Discord, they’re not public.</description>
